Execution begins in boot.s, and goes to kernel_main(), in kernel_main.c.
After that, execution is interrupt-driven, so looking at the kernel_main
function will be pointless: it's an infinite loop. The purpose of the kernel
is to respond to interrupts, from user-mode software, and external hardware,
e.g.: keyboards.
Compiling on Winblows:
[UNTESTED]
You will need the MinGW GCC port as well as the make utility.
You might need to change the CC variable in the Makefile to your compiler
Change directory (at a command prompt) to the source directory
Run 'make'
This will generate a Multiboot-compatible boot image, called bootImage.bin
Running:
You will need the GRUB bootloader installed
At the GRUB boot menu, hit 'c'
Type: "multiboot (hd0, msdosX)/path_to_source_dir/bootImage.bin", where X is the number of your Windows partition.
This will load the kernel
Then type "boot", and the kernel will load

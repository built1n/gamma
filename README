Overview:
Execution begins in boot.s, and goes to kernel_main(), in kernel_main.c.
After that, execution is interrupt-driven, so looking at the kernel_main
function will be pointless: it's an infinite loop. The purpose of the kernel
is to get the computer in a usable state, and then respond to interrupts, 
from software and hardware, e.g.: keyboards.

Compiling on Winblows:
[UNTESTED]
You will need the MinGW GCC port as well as the make utility.
Edit the Makefile so that the 
CC=gcc
line reads
CC=mingw32-gcc
This will change to the MinGW GCC compiler.
Change directory (at a command prompt) to the source directory.
Run 'mingw32-make'
This will generate a Multiboot-compatible boot image, called bootImage.bin

Running:
You will need the GRUB bootloader installed
At the GRUB boot menu, hit 'c'
Type: "multiboot (hd0, msdosX)/path_to_source_dir/bootImage.bin", where X is the number of your Windows partition.
This will load the kernel
Then type "boot", and the kernel will load and run
